# Portfolio-Webpage
A webpage displaying my current deployed projects and a section introducing myself.

## Built With
I used HTML and CSS to create my portfolio, I am using Github Pages to deploy the site at the moment. All projects displayed on the portfolio were created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
The navigation bar at the top will scroll down to the section you click on. The webpage can be viewed on a screen as small as a typical phone, the information will properly re-arrange to fit the screen.

## Visuals
The four sections should appear like this when deployed:
<img
  src="portfolio-home.png"
  alt="portfolio-home"
  title="Portfolio"
  style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 300px">
  <img
  src="portfolio-about.png"
  alt="portfolio-about"
  title="Portfolio"
  style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 300px">
  <img
  src="portfolio-work.png"
  alt="portfolio-work"
  title="Portfolio"
  style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 300px">
  <img
  src="portfolio-contact.png"
  alt="portfolio-contact"
  title="Portfolio"
  style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 300px">
